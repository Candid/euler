;; Problem 1
;; 05 October 2001

;; If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.
;; The sum of these multiples is 23.

;; Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

(reduce + (for [i (range 1 1000) :when (or (divides? 3 i) (divides? 5 i))] i))


;; Problem 2
;; 19 October 2001

;; Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
;; By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

;; 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

;; By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
;; find the sum of the even-valued terms.
