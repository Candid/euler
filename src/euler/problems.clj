;; Problem 1
;; 05 October 2001

;; If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.
;; The sum of these multiples is 23.

;; Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

(reduce + (for [i (range 1 1000) :when (or (divides? 3 i) (divides? 5 i))] i))


;; Problem 2
;; 19 October 2001

;; Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
;; By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

;; 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

;; By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
;; find the sum of the even-valued terms.

(reduce + (for [i fibs :while (<= i 4000000) :when (even? i)] i))


;; Problem 3
;; 02 November 2001

;; The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

;; What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

(last (factors 600851475143))


;; Problem 4
;; 16 November 2001

;; A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from
;; the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91  99.

;; Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

(let [r (range 100 1000)]
  (reduce max (for [i r j r :let [p (* i j)] :when (palindrome? p)] p)))


;; Problem 5
;; 30 November 2001

;; 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

;; What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
